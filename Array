Suppose that points is an array of 10 components of type double, and 
points = {9.9, 9.6, 8.5, 8.5, 7.8, 7.7, 6.5, 5.8, 5.8, 4.6}
The following is supposed to ensure that the elements of points are in 
nonincreasing order. What is the output of this code? There are errors 
in the code. Find and correct the errors. (1, 2, 3)
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
 if (points[i + 1] >= points[i])
 cout << "points[" << i << "] and points[" << (i + 1)
 << "] are out of order." << endl
